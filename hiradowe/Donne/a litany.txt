I. 

THE FATHER.

FATHER of Heaven, and Him, by whom 
It, and us for it, and all else for us, 
Thou madest, and govern'st ever, come 
And re-create me, now grown ruinous: 
My heart is by dejection, clay, 
And by self-murder, red. 
From this red earth, O Father, purge away 
All vicious tinctures, that new-fashioned 
I may rise up from death, before I'm dead. 


II. 
THE SON.

O Son of God, who, seeing two things, 
Sin and Death, crept in, which were never made, 
By bearing one, tried'st with what stings 
The other could Thine heritage invade ; 
O be Thou nail'd unto my heart, 
And crucified again ; 
Part not from it, though it from Thee would part, 
But let it be by applying so Thy pain, 
Drown'd in Thy blood, and in Thy passion slain. 


III. 

THE HOLY GHOST.

O Holy Ghost, whose temple I 
Am, but of mud walls , and condensed dust, 
And being sacrilegiously 
Half wasted with youth's fires of pride and lust, 
Must with new storms be weather-beat, 
Double in my heart Thy flame, 
Which let devout sad tears intend, and let— 
Though this glass lanthorn, flesh, do suffer maim— 
Fire, sacrifice, priest, altar be the same.
